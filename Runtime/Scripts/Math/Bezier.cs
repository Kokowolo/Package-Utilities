*       "A Bézier curve is defined by a sequence of points. It starts at the first point and ends at the last point, but 
*       does not need to go through the intermediate points. Instead, those points pull the curve away from being a 
*       straight line. [...] The idea of Bézier curves is that they are parametric. If you give it a value, typically 
*       named t, between zero and one, you get a point on the curve. As t increases from zero to one, you move from the
*       first point of the curve to the last point."
